pixi-keyboard
======================

pixi-keyboard is a plugin for Pixi.js to manage the keyboard events easily.

## Installation
```
npm install pixi-keyboard
```

## Usage

```js
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';
import 'pixi-keyboard'; // side effect import

// animationFrame...
// Update the keyboards events at the end of your request animation frame or your set interval.
PIXI.keyboardManager.update(delta);
// ...endsOfAnimationFrame
```

##How it works
This plugin add a new namespace named `keyboard` with 3 new classes (KeyboardManager, Key and HotKey) to the PIXI namespace, and create an instance for KeyboardManager in PIXI.keyboardManager, but you don't need worry about that, all you need is add PIXI.keyboardManager.update() in the end of your requestAnimationFrame or [AnimationLoop](https://github.com/Nazariglez/pixi-animationloop/).

### Events
KeyboardManager extends from [PIXI.utils.EventEmitter](https://github.com/primus/eventemitter3), and emit three events: pressed, down and released. All these events has as param the keyCode. More info: [Node.js Events](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_emit_event_arg1_arg2)
```js
PIXI.keyboardManager.on('down', function(key){
  //If a key is down
  console.log('Key down:' + key);
});

PIXI.keyboardManager.on('pressed', function(key){
  //If a key was pressed
  console.log('Key pressed:' + key);
});

PIXI.keyboardManager.on('released', function(key){
  //If a key was released
  console.log('Key released:' + key);
});
```

### Check the state for one key
```js
if(PIXI.keyboardManager.isPressed(PIXI.keyboard.Key.CTRL)){
  console.log('Control key is pressed');
}

if(PIXI.keyboardManager.isDown(PIXI.keyboard.Key.CTRL)){
  console.log('Control key is down');
}

if(PIXI.keyboardManager.isReleased(PIXI.keyboard.Key.CTRL)){
  console.log('Control key is released');
}
```

### Using HotKeys
```js
var shoot = PIXI.keyboardManager.getHotKey(PIXI.keyboard.Key.SPACE);
var reload = PIXI.keyboardManager.getHotKey(PIXI.keyboard.Key.R);

function animate(){
  window.requestAnimationFrame(animate);

  if(shoot.isPressed){
    if(shoot.ctrl){
      console.log('Nuke bomb!');
    }else{
      console.log('Normal shot');
    }
  }

  if(reload.isReleased){
    console.log('Reload my gun');
  }

  PIXI.keyboardManager.update();
}
animate();
```
